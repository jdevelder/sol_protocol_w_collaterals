# sol_protocol_w_collaterals
CIS5730 - Solidity Project - Lending Protocol with Collaterals

The core components of the project include:

Token Creation: Creation of an ERC20 token (MyToken) used within the lending platform.
Lending Platform Contract: Implementation of a lending platform that utilizes MyToken for transactions, featuring functions for lending, borrowing, and repaying tokens, with an interest calculation based on the loan duration.
Deployment and Interaction: Deployment of these contracts on a simulated Ethereum environment and interaction through transactions such as lending, borrowing, and repayment.
Testing and Security: Focus on writing tests for the smart contracts and ensuring they are secure against common vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy attacks.
